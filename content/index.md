This website serves as an archive/portfolio of my projects and blog posts. It provides a centralized, public place to access my work. 

As people does, interests, focus and skills change over time. This website is a living document that will be updated as I work on new projects and write new blog posts.

### Navigation

I have divided the website into two main sections:

- **[Projects](projects.html)**: Purely technical developments and meditations on technology
- **[Blog](blogs.html)**: Opinions, idea exploration

The website is made with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to keep it simple and lightweight. As having a reduced set of dependencies makes it faster to load and easier to maintain by a single person (me).
