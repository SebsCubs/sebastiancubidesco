# 11/13/2025 Cheap air cargo for remote areas and microgrid management

Many regions in south and central america have been historically isolated because of its geographical features. As Colombia modernizes, seeks to expand connectivity and the adoption of technology, we face two big challenges in the south american context: Limited resources and nature conservation. I will take an example from my own experience growing up. 

Being a very mountainous country, with the largest amount of rainfall per year in the planet and a sizable seismic activity, building and maintaining roads is especially difficult and expensive. At the same time, a big percentage of the land is covered by valuable rainforests that we don't want to disrupt. In the experience of the neighbouring country of Brazil, building roads into the Amazon rainforest (although with the best of intentions) has exacerbated the rate of deforestation and illegal activities in isolated regions. Illegal mining, unregulated logging, and unregulated cattle expansion degrade ecosystems rapidly when unchecked.

It is not only problems though, it has been said that Colombia is immune to dictatorships(don't quote me on that one) in part because of the big difficulty to control all the territory. And whether that statement is truth or not, Colombia is in fact one of the longest-standing democracies in South America. Where many of the countries in the region went through decades-long authoritarian regimes, the only dictator in the country (Gustavo Rojas Pinilla) lasted for about 4 years before he gave up power, after kickstarting a meaningful technological modernization push in the country. 

As the country started modernizing, the airplanes arrived as well. And given the bizarre geography of Colombia, the airports gained popularity quickly. Being the third country with the most airports in South America and with a thriving domestic flight market, it has become one of the principal means of passenger transportation in the country. 

**However, cargo tells a different story.**

Although the El Dorado airport in Bogota is the most frequented airport for cargo transportation in the region, internal cargo is done mainly through large semi-truck transportation.

This, as mentioned before has major infrastructure costs, given the instability of the land's surface in most of the populated territory. This has resulted in frequent landslides leaving small towns isolated for long stretches of time. Very hard to reach regions that have virtually no presence of the state forces and constant disruptions of major infrastructure projects. 

The list is almost endless, projects like the main highway to the oriental plains, Hidroituango, the Chirajara bridge and so on. 

Another unfortunate side effect of this isolation and lack of state presence is a power vacuum in the isolated regions, which has always encouraged self-governing structures which operate as de-facto states in these parts of the country. Through all the Colombian history this has frequently erupted in waves of violence and territorial disputes that even today seem like an endless curse in our beautiful land. 

The arrival of narcotraffic only made the problem worse, empowering these violent structures even further by providing very profitable meanings of existence and ways of arm themselves. I won't touch too much on this, as the news and even Netflix have done more than enough explaining this problematic... 

The state has also made incountable mistakes that fueled this violence, but as the democratic process strengthens, the ultimate hope is that we all build a state that can be trusted and acts with the best possible faith for the progress and protection of life. This is a whole tangent that is worth exploring later.

## Can technology paint a different picture?

I wanted to focus on how this could be improved through intelligent innovation. 

A simple idea comes to mind after this analysis: If the cost of flight mile-ton decreases to a level that makes it feasible for isolated communities to establish trade and surveillance in the vast, difficult territory, it could provide both economic alternatives to illegal activities and a means for the state to enforce the law in hard-to-reach places. 

Imagine pick-up truck-sized, unmanned cargo airships that can land on water bodies, or unpaved, 2000 ft long airways (Like the ones [poseidon aero](https://www.poseidonaero.com/aircraft) is trying to make). An autonomous system orchestrating a swarm of these relatively cheap airplanes could enable towns like Landazuri, Santander to keep trading their cacao beans and other agricultural products without having to rely on the constantly-accidented main road connecting it with the center of the country. This road in particular has rarely had a year without landslides since its creation in the mid 20th century!

To be clear, this would not be a replacement for traditional roads, and the struggle to create and maintain these ways will continue to be a national challenge, however, providing a solid option that can adapt to specific cases remains very interesting. 

I will make happy calculations on the costs of this in the next blog post.
